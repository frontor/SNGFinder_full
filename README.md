# SNGFinder
SNGFinder is a tool for identifying new genes based on the syntenic method. It requires a focal species (the species for which the new gene needs to be identified), species of the same lineage or genus as the focal species, and outgroup species. Syntenic regions are obtained based on whole genome alignment, and clusters of genes orthologous to the focal species genes are obtained within the same syntenic region. If a focal species gene has no orthologous genes in any outgroup in a orthologous cluster, then the gene is a new gene. In addition, SNGFinder can classify new genes into copy number variation genes, duplicate genes, and orphan genes based on the origin mechanism.

# How to use
Identifying new genes requires the following steps:  
1. [Repeat masker](#1-repeat-masker)
2. [Whole genome alignment](#2-whole-genome-alignment)
3. [Identification of new genes](#3-identification-of-new-genes)
## 1. Repeat masker
```
windowmasker -mk_counts -in genome.fasta -out genome.counts
windowmasker -ustat genome.counts -in genome.fasta -out genome_masked.fasta -dust true -outfmt fasta
```
`genome_masked.fasta` is the repeat soft-masking fasta file for whole genome alignment.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> `RepeatMasker` is recommended, but `WindowMasker` is used here.
> If the genome has been repeat soft-masked, skip this step.  
> The genomes downloaded from NCBI or Ensembl usually have been repeat soft-masked.  
  
## 2. Whole genome alignment
### 2.1 Alignment
```
cactus --binariesMode local --defaultMemory 100G --defaultDisk 30G job_store SpAll.txt SpAll.hal
```
`job_store` is used to store intermediate files.  
`SpAll.txt` is a text file containing the locations of the input sequences as well as their phylogenetic tree.  
  
For a detailed explanation of this file, please refer to the [cactus documentation](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/progressive.md#interface).  
`SpAll.hal` is cactus output  
  
**The file is formatted as follows:**  
```
(Sp1:0.23781,((Sp2:0.335387,Sp3:0.399047)N2:0.0755071,((Sp4:0.0245695,Sp5:0.0279553)N4:0.0525508,(Sp6:0.0735841,(Sp7:0.072269,(Sp8:0.0329604,Sp9:0.0467526)N7:0.0277942)N6:0.028579)N5:0.0253669)N3:0.281769)N1:0.23781)N0;
Sp1 Sp1_genome.fasta
Sp2 Sp2_genome.fasta
Sp3 Sp3_genome.fasta
Sp4 Sp4_genome.fasta
Sp5 Sp5_genome.fasta
Sp6 Sp6_genome.fasta
Sp7 Sp7_genome.fasta
Sp8 Sp8_genome.fasta
Sp9 Sp9_genome.fasta
```
> [!NOTE]
>The species name in the `SpAll.txt` can not include `.`.  
[Cactus](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus) may be slow, so you can use a [cluster](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/progressive.md#running-on-a-cluster) or [GPU](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/progressive.md#gpu-acceleration) to speed it up.  
`Cactus` used the system temporary directory `/tmp` by default. If the prompt space is insufficient, you may need to use `--workdir` to specify the temporary directory.  
### 2.2 MAF export
```
hal2maf --maxBlockLen 100000 --noAncestors --noDupes --onlyOrthologs --unique --refGenome Sp1 SpAll.hal stdout|taffy view|taffy add-gap-bases -a SpAll.hal|taffy norm -k -d |mafFilter -m - -N 0.95 |mafDuplicateFilter -m - -k |bgzip >SpAll_ref_Sp1.maf.gz
```
`SpAll.hal` is the input.  
`--refGenome` a focal species for new gene identification.  
`SpAll_ref_Sp1.maf.gz` is the maf format output.  
  
For detailed instructions on MAF export, please refer to [here](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/progressive.md#maf-export).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>Errors may be reported on NFS file system. It is recommended to run on SSD.  
## 3. Identification of new genes
### Target file
**A `target` file is required, the format is as follows：**
```
Sp1 Sp1_genome.fasta.gz Sp1_protein.faa.gz  Sp1_gene.bed    Sp1_gene_to_protein.txt in
Sp2 Sp2_genome.fasta.gz Sp2_protein.faa.gz  Sp2_gene.bed    Sp2_gene_to_protein.txt in
Sp3 Sp3_genome.fasta.gz Sp3_protein.faa.gz  Sp3_gene.bed    Sp3_gene_to_protein.txt in
Sp4 Sp4_genome.fasta.gz Sp4_protein.faa.gz  Sp4_gene.bed    Sp4_gene_to_protein.txt in
Sp5 Sp5_genome.fasta.gz Sp5_protein.faa.gz  Sp5_gene.bed    Sp5_gene_to_protein.txt in
Sp6 Sp6_genome.fasta.gz Sp6_protein.faa.gz  Sp6_gene.bed    Sp6_gene_to_protein.txt in
Sp7 Sp7_genome.fasta.gz Sp7_protein.faa.gz  Sp7_gene.bed    Sp7_gene_to_protein.txt out
Sp8 Sp8_genome.fasta.gz Sp8_protein.faa.gz  Sp8_gene.bed    Sp8_gene_to_protein.txt out
Sp9 Sp9_genome.fasta.gz Sp9_protein.faa.gz  Sp9_gene.bed    Sp9_gene_to_protein.txt out
```
The `target` file has six columns, each separated by the `tab` key.  
The `first column` is species name.  
The `second column` is the fasta genome sequence.  
The `third column` is the fasta protein sequence.  
The `fourth column` is the genes bed file. The bed format only requires the first six columns, please refer to [here](https://grch37.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/bed.html) for details.  
The `fifth column` is the correspondence file between gene names and protein names. This file has two columns. The first column is the gene name and the second column is the protein name corresponding to the gene name.  
The `sixth column` is used to mark whether it is an outgroup species. If it is an outgroup species, fill in `out`. If not, fill in `in`.

### Output
`TestSp9_NewGenesOrphan.xls` Orphan genes in focus species. The other columns represent genes that are orthologous to the genes of the focal species.  
  
`TestSp9_NewGenesRepeat.xls` CNV genes in focus species. The other columns represent genes that are orthologous to the genes of the focal species. Which genes in the focus species are CNV with each other is not provided in this table. You can search for the information in the `TestSp9_RepeatList.txt` file.  
  
`TestSp9_NewGenesParalog.xls` Duplicated genes in focus species. The other columns represent genes that are orthologous to the genes of the focal species. Which genes in the focus species are duplicated with each other is not provided in this table. You can search for them in the `TestSp9_paralog_mcl.out` file, but don't forget to exclude the CNVs in the `TestSp9_RepeatList.txt` file.  
  
`TestSp9_OrthoGroupCluster.xls` Genes that are orthologous to the genes of the focus species.  
  
`TestSp9_ChimerasTrans.xls` Potential chimeric genes in the focal species. If the genes in the focus species are separated by commas, it is fission in the focus species; if there is only one gene in the focus species, it is fusion. The other columns represent the genes supporting this chimeric gene in other species.

In the table, genes containing the word `translocation` indicate that translocation may have occurred at that position, while genes containing `*_region*::*:*-*.pep*` indicate unannotated genes.  

## De-novo classifier (added in this repository)

This repository extends the SNGFinder identification tool with the
machine-learning classifier that assigns each orphan gene a
**de-novo / old / unclassified** status, implemented by two scripts at the
repository root:

- `ModelTrain_v3.py` — trains and evaluates the classifier (XGBoost by default,
  with an AdaCost branch for comparison) on the SNGFinder orphan output.
- `adacost.py` — a self-contained, dependency-free implementation of the
  cost-sensitive AdaCost classifier (Fan, Stolfo & Zhang, ICML 1999) that
  `ModelTrain_v3.py` imports. AdaCost is vendored here because it is not on PyPI,
  so both classifier branches reproduce from this package alone.

### Usage

`ModelTrain_v3.py` takes positional arguments
`<Classifier> <Training_Dataset.csv> <Test_Dataset.csv> <Orphan_Dataset.csv>
<prefix> <test_size> <label_col> <ppv> <npv> <max_depth> <n_estimators> <outdir>`,
where `<Classifier>` is `XGBoost` or `AdaCost`.

Examples:

    # headline XGBoost model
    python ModelTrain_v3.py \
        XGBoost Training_Dataset.csv Test_Dataset.csv Orphan_Dataset.csv \
        A_ppv0.95_npv0.995_30_200 0.2 A 0.95 0.995 30 200 revision_outputs

    # AdaCost comparison model (requires adacost.py, vendored in this directory)
    python ModelTrain_v3.py \
        AdaCost Training_Dataset.csv Test_Dataset.csv Orphan_Dataset.csv \
        A_ppv0.95_npv0.995_30_200 0.2 A 0.95 0.995 30 200 revision_outputs

The classifier applies a dual-threshold abstention rule
(`t_low` / `t_high`) so low-confidence orphans are reported as `unclassified`
rather than forced into de-novo / old. The 59-feature set is documented in
`Table S11` (manuscript supplementary material).

## Supplementary analysis scripts (`scripts/`)

`scripts/` holds the article-specific downstream analyses built on the SNGFinder
orphan set and the classifier output. They are research scripts (not a general
pipeline) and depend on intermediate datasets produced by the SNGFinder pipeline
/ classifier; each script documents its expected input files (see `scripts/README.md`).

- `scripts/threeway2.py` — three-way outgroup-homology audit of the orphan set
  (de_novo_noncoding / independent_occupier / oryza_clade / old_preOryza).
- `scripts/strata_and_audit.py` — origination-stratum analysis of the oryza_clade
  orphans by phylogenetic depth.
